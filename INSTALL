                                  INSTALL

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) Get BLAS (preferably a more efficient ATLAS-implementation),
     LAPACK and G2C (see README for details) and install these libraries.

     If the libraries are installed in a non-standard place, you may
     need to set the paths to the include files and to the static or
     shared libraries in Makefile.conf (variables INCDIRS, LIBDIRS,
     BLAS, LAPACK and F2C) or on the command line.

     If you use MacOS X, you may have to install vecLib, which is
     available here:

       http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/MacOSX/vecLib.html

  2) If there is anything non-standard about your OCaml-installation,
     look at the default settings in "OCamlMakefile" and set them to
     the values that are valid on your system, you can do this also by
     setting environment variables.  This is greatly simplified if you
     normally use "OCamlMakefile" and have already configured your shell
     environment in startup files appropriately.

     You will need Gerd Stolpmann's "findlib"-tool!

  3) Don't forget: you will need GNU-make!

     Enter "make" in the top directory to compile the library.

  4) Enter "make install" to install the library.

  x) If you want to compile the examples, enter "make examples".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 UNINSTALL

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) Easy: just enter "make uninstall". This will remove all files
     installed by "make install".

Enjoy!
